         "Important ethical talk from November 2023 around the time I got into generative AI, although outdated by now from a technical point of view. It's true however that copyright infringement definately will and already is a problem. With all the powerful AI tools and models in upcoming 2026, including my own ones, anyone can train their own complex models on anything you can find and download on the internet, such as vast libraries of text books, photos, images, videos, audio, videogames, anything.\n\nWe are now entering the limitless and abundant Age of Artificial Intelligence. My personal prediction is that even copyright issues will be replaced by AI where nobody will own anything digital anymore, not even the corporations who provide AI platforms. Ownership will disappear on the internet. Some of us artists will be scared by that and against it ofcourse, including the music and Hollywood film industry, others may see it as an opportunity where anyone can share and use their content with each other to create something bigger.\n\nSo yeah, it's a critical question if we as humanity want to go that far with all the AI at our disposal. I also guess each country will make up their own laws how they want to manage these important issues, including bias, racism and other negative things included in AI. For instance, India has recently introduced laws where any image uploaded has to be labeled whether it is real or AI-generated.",

         "AI Is Dangerous, but Not for the Reasons You Think | Sasha Luccioni | TED",
         "AI won't kill us all — but that doesn't make it trustworthy. Instead of getting distracted by future existential risks, AI ethics researcher Sasha Luccioni thinks we need to focus on the technology's current negative impacts, like emitting carbon, infringing copyrights and spreading biased information. She offers practical solutions to regulate our AI-filled future — so it's inclusive and transparent.\n\nIf you love watching TED Talks like this one, become a TED Member to support our mission of spreading ideas: https://ted.com/membership\n\nFollow TED! \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TEDTalks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ted\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/TED\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ted-conferences\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tedtoks\n\nThe TED Talks channel features talks, performances and original series from the world's leading thinkers and doers.
