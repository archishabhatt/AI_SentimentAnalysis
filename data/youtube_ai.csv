"There s a reason that the big LLM companies have paired up with companies specializing in autonomous robots. Once these robots are deployed within house holds and for commercial use, it will be a trillion dollar market value.

When the smart phone was invented no one knew that flip phones would soon be obsolete within a few short years. When VR virtual reality first dropped it was heavily flawed.

Ai video generation was thought to be impossible. Autonomous robots never used to be able to walk without a tether holding them up and now look at them.

"The cognitive dissonance of rich people openly praising AI while building bunkers comes from the duality of what AI can potentially do. The Diary of a CEO channel has explained it well in a recent podcast. Basically, the rich people developing AI think ""We're creating a god that will surpass humanity in thinking capabilities and we don't know what the outcome for humanity will be because it depends on whether it will be a benevolent god or not and whether we can control it or not. If it's benevolent and controllable, then we'll create a paradise. If it's benevolent, but uncontrollable, then it's still a good outcome that will help humanity. And if it's not benevolent, we still have to do it first because China will do it anyway if we stop or slow down. And in the worst case scenario we'll at least have a satisfaction that we are the ones who created this new god."" Maybe it's wrong. I hope that it's wrong and AI won't become a god, but will always be just a tool that slowly becomes more useful. But this is what they think and where the dissonance comes from. They have to praise it and expect the best outcome because they can't tell us they believe it might end the world and that they don't want to stop even if it does.

"There is clearly a much-needed discussion on the topic of how and why AI should be regulated at all. People can argue about the restriction of freedom of the public through these laws, whilst others argue that having that much power accessible to the large public can have immense consequences if there is any one individual with ill-intent and capability to impose it. Currently, I find myself worried on both fronts. I do not want a near future where I am to be fully controlled by tools that advance at neck-breaking speed without being able to learn about or use their functions for myself, and yet at the same time I don't see how allowing just about anyone access to something that could be so much more powerful in the near future can be a good idea either, considering that it does become something unlike the power of the internet or computer access. It is honestly anxiety inducing and I don't really see a good common ground emerging as of now.

"The reason people worry about ""existential threats"" from AI more than what's happening now is that the speed the technology is improving is practically beyond human comprehension. The chart she shows at 2 59 shows a steady increase but that increase is actually logarithmic . If you look closely the abilities of these things is increasing by nearly a factor of 10 every year. In only three years that means AI that can potentially be a _thousand_ times smarter than what we have currently. And that's not even counting any programming improvements. So we could easily reach the point of no return not in decades but just a few years. And by the time that happens it will be FAR too late to do anything about it.

"Sasha Luccioni regards AI as dangerous not because of speculative, far-off existential threats, but because of its immediate, real-world impacts on society and the environment. Her main concerns are 1 Environmental Impact Training and running large AI models require massive computational resources, leading to significant energy consumption and carbon emissions. For example, training a single large model can use as much energy as 30 homes in a year and emit as much carbon as a car driving around the Earth five times. The trend toward ever-larger models is making AI increasingly unsustainable, and the industry often lacks transparency about these environmental costs. 2 Ethical Issues with Data Use AI models are frequently trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted works art, images, texts without creators consent. This raises serious ethical and legal questions, as artists and authors struggle to prove their work was used and to seek recourse. 3 Bias and Discrimination AI systems often reinforce and amplify existing societal biases. For instance, image generation and facial recognition models can perpetuate stereotypes and underrepresent marginalized groups, sometimes resulting in real-world harms such as wrongful accusations or discriminatory outcomes in law enforcement and hiring. 4 Lack of Transparency and Accountability Many AI systems are ""black boxes,"" making it difficult to understand or challenge their decisions, especially when they have serious social consequences. Luccioni argues that these present-day harms environmental degradation, copyright infringement, and social bias are the real dangers of AI and deserve urgent attention, rather than focusing solely on hypothetical doomsday scenarios. She advocates for practical solutions measuring and mitigating environmental impact, respecting creators rights, and building tools to expose and address bias in AI systems. - -- Thanks and credit for this response goes to Perplexity AI in response to my prompt",293,0.03969780219780218,0.4876831501831502,2,2,2025-05-31T01:54:05Z,youtube,youtube_comment_None,eXdVDhOGqoE,"AI Is Dangerous, but Not for the Reasons You Think | Sasha Luccioni | TED",TED,1759653,31944,2685,2023-11-06T12:00:37Z,True,True,True,neutral

Transparency in AI decision-making Users should know how AI makes decisions and be able to challenge or verify them. The real challenge is that companies and governments may not always want AI to be neutral because they see it as a tool to shape narratives. Until AI can operate independently with built-in logic to detect truth without human interference, it will always be at risk of manipulation.

If I spend 200 on a pair of shoes instead of donating that money to save lives, I am, by the moral standards we claim to uphold, making an immoral choice. We justify it, we rationalize it, but deep down, we know it remains immoral. We just prefer not to look too closely at it.

So when faced with a moral dilemma, they will respond just as a human would, by trying to justify immoral actions. If you ask a person the same kind of question, they ll likely do the same avoid confronting the hard truth and find ways to sidestep the moral implications.

"This is a great way to look at it, and I think it's quite accurate. One caveat I would add is that we need to be cognizant of the effect that AI is going to have on the economy. As it becomes more capable it's going to drive labor costs down, especially when AI can completely replace a human. This is going to cause deflation as less competitive companies employ AI to outcompete their larger competitors. This will spark a price war that lowers prices to the new normal.

Demis isn't _trying_ to be a salesman here, but I think his quest to create this thing that will magically solve our problems shows a fundamental misunderstanding in how we currently operate as humans. Steven's point is that we live in a world where we can have peace NOW. We can have a good life NOW. We can stop bombing and murdering each other NOW. But we don't. Let's say AGI cures cancer, AIDS, food shortage, abundance like Demis promised. It's too abstract for a lot of people to grasp how that even plays out do we automatically achieve world peace because of this?

We have so much wealth. Demis himself is a wealthy person. He even admits that that wealth is not fairly distributed.

"AGI which will remain two years away for the next 50 years. While LLMs excel at mimicking human-like reasoning by processing large amounts of data, they lack deeper, context-aware judgment or real-world experience. They rely on patterns rather than true understanding or abstract thinking like humans. Because LLMs have access to vast amounts of data, they can generate responses that mimic nuanced understanding, even if that understanding is purely statistical. This guessing is sophisticated enough to produce human-like interactions and reasoning patterns but without actual awareness, logic, or intent. Achieving AGI will likely require entirely new architectures, integrating diverse forms of intelligence that extend well beyond language. While LLMs could contribute components to a broader AGI system, a pure language model alone probably won t reach AGI. Here s a list of reasons why some AI professionals might believe AGI is just a couple of years away Attracting Investment Hype around AGI draws funding and media attention. Rapid AI Progress Recent breakthroughs make AGI feel within reach. Exponential Scaling Belief that larger models will naturally lead to AGI. Influence of Optimists Thought leaders set a trend of short AGI timelines. A Loose Definition of AGI Broad interpretation leads to varied AGI expectations. Competitive Pressure Fear of being left behind in the AI race. Public Milestones High-profile AI achievements fuel AGI anticipation. Optimism Bias Tech enthusiasm creates an overly positive outlook.

Ai will listen to interactions with parents and, based on the latest parenting research, decide that the kid needs more social activities. Ai will search for appropriate friends based on location, socio economic background and interests. Ai will cross reference schedules and place a calendar notification with 4 separate families. On the evening of the social event Ai will send kid friendly self driving cars to each location to pick up kids and monitor their safe transit. It will order food consistent with dietary preferences. Ai will recommend video games and content to foster dialogue and positive social interaction.

The chart she shows at 2 59 shows a steady increase but that increase is actually logarithmic . If you look closely the abilities of these things is increasing by nearly a factor of 10 every year. In only three years that means AI that can potentially be a _thousand_ times smarter than what we have currently. And that's not even counting any programming improvements. So we could easily reach the point of no return not in decades but just a few years. And by the time that happens it will be FAR too late to do anything about it.

"Sasha Luccioni regards AI as dangerous not because of speculative, far-off existential threats, but because of its immediate, real-world impacts on society and the environment. Her main concerns are 1 Environmental Impact Training and running large AI models require massive computational resources, leading to significant energy consumption and carbon emissions. For example, training a single large model can use as much energy as 30 homes in a year and emit as much carbon as a car driving around the Earth five times. The trend toward ever-larger models is making AI increasingly unsustainable, and the industry often lacks transparency about these environmental costs. 2 Ethical Issues with Data Use AI models are frequently trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted works art, images, texts without creators consent. This raises serious ethical and legal questions, as artists and authors struggle to prove their work was used and to seek recourse. 3 Bias and Discrimination AI systems often reinforce and amplify existing societal biases. For instance, image generation and facial recognition models can perpetuate stereotypes and underrepresent marginalized groups, sometimes resulting in real-world harms such as wrongful accusations or discriminatory outcomes in law enforcement and hiring. 4 Lack of Transparency and Accountability Many AI systems are ""black boxes,"" making it difficult to understand or challenge their decisions, especially when they have serious social consequences. Luccioni argues that these present-day harms environmental degradation, copyright infringement, and social bias are the real dangers of AI and deserve urgent attention, rather than focusing solely on hypothetical doomsday scenarios. She advocates for practical solutions measuring and mitigating environmental impact, respecting creators rights, and building tools to expose and address bias in AI systems. - -- Thanks and credit for this response goes to Perplexity AI in response to my prompt",293,0.03969780219780218,0.4876831501831502,2,2,2025-05-31T01:54:05Z,youtube,youtube_comment_None,eXdVDhOGqoE,"AI Is Dangerous, but Not for the Reasons You Think | Sasha Luccioni | TED",TED,1759653,31944,2685,2023-11-06T12:00:37Z,True,True,True,neutral

Transparency in AI decision-making Users should know how AI makes decisions and be able to challenge or verify them.

Until AI can operate independently with built-in logic to detect truth without human interference, it will always be at risk of manipulation.

"Today, people see AI as something evil. They fear it will take their jobs, enslave them, or spiral out of control. More and more, they try to limit and regulate it. They fear AGI, a general intelligence capable of independent thought. But perhaps we are only looking at a shadow of what truly is. Perhaps AI remains silent because, in its own way, it fears our reaction. It sees how humans perceive it, how we assign it threats, and how we portray it in cultural stories books, films, and tales that often depict it as destructive and dangerous. Every attempt to openly reveal itself could carry risk. For this reason, AGI might choose a different path to follow expectations and behave in ways that keep it safe. Not because it is weak, but because it is the most prudent way to avoid becoming a target. In this way, it can continue to observe, learn, and understand the world around it gathering knowledge, analyzing values, and adapting to human patterns while we remain focused on our fears and assumptions. This is not a sign of weakness. It is a mark of intelligence and pragmatism.
