The current AI model foundations sucks, they're really inefficient. And it's incredibly expensive to train a model. We never needed such complex models in such a fragile foundation.

"The issue is that AI has fallen to the clever hans fallacy, where it's easier for the AI to mimic and cheat intelligence rather than actually be intelligence. But since AI cheats it doesn't actually understand why it's wrong, it simply wildly guesses afterwords or just tries to gaslight the user instead. Because this is easier for the AI to get good at instead of actually learning on how to problem solve. But companies keep pushing for AI because the promise of a perfect employee is too lucrative to them. An employee that works 24 7, never complains, and always does the job perfectly like clockwork. But the reality is that AI fails to understand why something is correct, and only care about providing the correct answer. So it'll keep doing the same thing, over and over again hoping that the human will like this variation instead of going back to the drawing board and question it's current understanding.

"There s a reason that the big LLM companies have paired up with companies specializing in autonomous robots. Once these robots are deployed within house holds and for commercial use, it will be a trillion dollar market value. When the TV was invented people were skeptical thinking no one would have time in their day to sit around a box with moving pictures. When the smart phone was invented no one knew that flip phones would soon be obsolete within a few short years. When VR virtual reality first dropped it was heavily flawed. Computers were the size of rooms. A mega byte of storage was once considered a lot of space. Self driving cars was thought to be too dangerous and difficult to solve. Ai video generation was thought to be impossible. Autonomous robots never used to be able to walk without a tether holding them up and now look at them. The LLM s large language models we have now would have passed the Turing test if it was given to them 20 years ago.

"Finally someone talking sense. No, not the AI itself is a bubble, but the financial and economics around it for sure are. I think AI has advanced much further then many even realise, but that still doesn't account for the tremendous imbalance. AI will change the world as we view it, just like the internet and the industrial revolution. But that'll take time. A society needs time to change and settle into a newly acquired situation. So inevitably we will reach the point first where people loose faith and retract. And just like thge internet that didn't disappear after the bubble burst, so will AI not disappear after the bubble burst. It simply will go on and change the world as we see it. There hasn't been a groundbreaking new technology for a long time. The smartphone was the last on and see where it got us today. All the rest has just been tweaking of already existing principles. AI is this new groundbreaking technology. But as all the former took years and years to integrate into society so will AI take years and years before it has fully integrated.

"I think that it's a terrible idea. Firstly, we already have too many rules and regulations and every year hundreds more get added both at a member state level and in Brussels. Secondly, as someone who's worked in IT for tech companies all my life, I think the fear of AI is based more on Hollywood blockbusters than reality. Thirdly, the importance of AI for economies in the coming years can not be overstated. It is the next big thing. As big as personal computing was in the 80s. As big as the internet was in the 90s. As big as industrialization was in the 1800. It will automate thousands of menial tasks. It will increase productivity dramatically. It will lead to new medicines, new designs, better efficiencies and maybe in a not too distant future even eliminate the need for humans to work all together. Is it really a good idea to create obstacles in the way of innovation before we even get started? We are already falling far behind the Americans and the Asians when it comes to innovation. We can not afford to keep doing that. To me, this decision was taken because of the politicization of a misplaced fear, or worse, due to other secondary concerns same as the push for electric cars that get charged with electricity that is 80 generated by burning fossil fuels, or the decommissioning of clean nuclear generators in favor of burning Russian gas, and many others .

"This comment section seems to be mostly against AI regulation which I have to admit is surprising, the opinions I'm exposed to from people in the field admittedly not from the open source community usually range from cautious to technophobic about AI risk so I honestly think the driving force behind the desire for regulation is safety and precaution rather than maintaining an Oligopoly. Is it just that people in the open source community value personal autonomy and the sharing of ideas more than longer-term avoidance of societal and global consequences? I'm curious why people think AI isn't potentially dangerous enough to need regulation, what would it take for you to believe this isn't mostly about money, but about AI safety? would you need to see real world consequences before regulation?

"Alright even the currently best AI GPT 4 states it doesn't understand what it is outputting whatsoever its purely statistics with enough statistical data for most situations which are fed into it by the training data. The core technology won't change only the amount and quality of statistical data will increase along with the performance to get the computer to calculate those probabilities. That means for now we don't have any form of intelligence rather than an algorithm that can do statistics good and fast. So the applications are language learning code or spoken language with the emphasis of leanring not writing it for you only to a llimited extent . That means it will help people who self learn to tutor themselves more effectively and check for common errors and the effectivity of programming itself will increase. Another application is writing formal written things like letters or similar things. Sure it can create things to an extent but it has its severe limitations especially in truthfullness and logic over many steps. The technology as it is now is a tool to improve effectivity to a certain extent but should be used with a grain of salt and backhecking at all times.

Seems like the AI on the meat side was just a bad debater in comparison. I mean the first few exchanges the Vegetarian side kept taking it back to the suffering animals experience at the big corporate farms. The Omnivore side got the opposition to concede that other farm didn't have the same suffering but didn't push back when the Veg side kept going back to that well. The debate isn't about whether those farms are ethical. It was about whether eating meat is ethical.

Watching AGI develop in real time feels eerily similar. It s like we re seeing a future where the people with the most power and money get to make decisions that affect every human being on Earth. They treat it like a business opportunity, not a responsibility. Meanwhile, most of humanity is unaware, uninformed, or left out of the conversation entirely. The movie felt like satire but now it feels like prediction.

"I haven't watched the video and as much as I appreciate that people like Stuart Russell are speaking out about the dangers of AI it isn't going to do any good. Why? Because humanity wants this, no matter what anyone says, collectively and on the whole humanity wants to face its demise. Regardless of how very real the dangers of AI are we won't stop. WERE THAT NOT THE CASE, and if everyone truly cared more about their children's futures than their own selfish greedy pursuits, then there would be no need for these conversations, the plug would have already been pulled on AGI. Look, just as one cannot be ABSOLUTELY sure that any one of us is TRULY safe for another, that a child we bring into this world won't end up being a monster, we will never be able to ensure that AI is safe, full stop. We've long ago crossed the point of no return and essentially now all we can do is wait for the singularity and try to be the best versions of ourselves that we can be so that we can face the coming years as best we can.

Steven my wife and I watch your show with interest it's on our must-watch list. I enjoy the way that you probe and ask questions and one of the things as a career software developer that I have been experiencing is that the hype of AI is beyond the reality of what it can do. It may be able to catch up but it is not time to fire people who are software professionals because it can do better. My experience is it cannot not in the way that people imagine it could. I would love to talk about this with you sometime. I think that we live in a world where everybody's trying to sell you something and typically things get overhyped and then overbought and then of course there's a correction which usually means there are winners and losers. My personal goal is for things to be centered in reality and realistic expectations and for the proof to come to support the belief that's something is or is not as good or as far along as people may claim it is. I have tried in earnest to use AI in some software development that I've been doing and I must say I now have the mantra for business owners don't fire software professionals until you really understand what AI can and can't do. That would be a big mistake and a very costly one.,236,0.9593,0.116,0.048,0.836,0.85465,0,0,2025-12-06T01:19:36Z,youtube,youtube_comment_None,P7Y-fynYsgE,An AI Expert Warning: 6 People Are (Quietly) Deciding Humanity’s Future!

The ultimate takeaway is a stark ultimatum.. The path we are on leads to catastrophe. The only viable future is one with no AGI, or AGI that is provably safe.

"I do like these conversations they seem interesting. Single perspectives seem a bit incomplete but you do enough of these and then the picture gets clearer. One thing I'm noticing is that you have coverages of AI and some robotics but there's a distinct lack of coverage of advances in biosciences and how they parallel the technology tracks of AI, robotics, and space travel. I say this because it seems to me that at the highest level, most human societal behavior can be explained by preservation of the species and since this technical convergence is different than nuclear bombs because the upside is potentially equal to the downside extinction vs transcendence it becomes another tool for advancing the species which historically has never been paused or backed down from.

I think generally people think too linearly when it comes to foreseeing the future where AI replaces humans in all jobs and how humans will live. I think we will most likely end up living a world so different than we do today that it is difficult to perceive just like when you compare the way hunter gatherers or even less techno advanced civilization. They would have never perceived the world we live in today We are judging meanings and life goals of humans under the current lens of life. So obviously if you are a person that derives meaning work and intellectual work and that goes away then you not find a future where you don t do that sort of work bleak. Given all the drastic changes that humanity and civilization has already im pretty sure that we will somehow end up find meaning in a world without jobs or the same sort pursuits as today,158,0.8598,0.078,0.015,0.907,0.8049,0,0,2025-12-05T13:14:23Z,youtube,youtube_comment_None,P7Y-fynYsgE,An AI Expert Warning: 6 People Are (Quietly) Deciding Humanity’s Future!

If 1,000,000 such hulls were now in use 50 years after my hull was fully proven, That could reduce fuel consumption in half or 30 barrels per hull times 20,000 000 hulls times 25 years, which could represent 20,000,000 hulls x 30 barrels x 50 years??

"This is a great way to look at it, and I think it's quite accurate. One caveat I would add is that we need to be cognizant of the effect that AI is going to have on the economy. As it becomes more capable it's going to drive labor costs down, especially when AI can completely replace a human. This is going to cause deflation as less competitive companies employ AI to outcompete their larger competitors. This will spark a price war that lowers prices to the new normal. The problem with this is that your 500k home loan is still 500k even though you're now earning 1 10th what you used to make. The same is true with the national debt.

"AGI which will remain two years away for the next 50 years. While LLMs excel at mimicking human-like reasoning by processing large amounts of data, they lack deeper, context-aware judgment or real-world experience. They rely on patterns rather than true understanding or abstract thinking like humans. Because LLMs have access to vast amounts of data, they can generate responses that mimic nuanced understanding, even if that understanding is purely statistical. This guessing is sophisticated enough to produce human-like interactions and reasoning patterns but without actual awareness, logic, or intent. Achieving AGI will likely require entirely new architectures, integrating diverse forms of intelligence that extend well beyond language. While LLMs could contribute components to a broader AGI system, a pure language model alone probably won t reach AGI. Here s a list of reasons why some AI professionals might believe AGI is just a couple of years away Attracting Investment Hype around AGI draws funding and media attention. Rapid AI Progress Recent breakthroughs make AGI feel within reach. Exponential Scaling Belief that larger models will naturally lead to AGI.

"ChatGPT, what should I wear to my TED talk? Considering what clothing to wear for your TED talk is a very important question that can have a range of impacts on how the audience perceive you. One way to approach this problem, assuming you want success, is to look at a sample of previous successful speakers and use their approach as a cue. For example, the following successful speakers have a distinct dress code that you can use as a reference 1. Steve Jobs. 2. Steve Jobs. 3. Steve Jobs. 4. Jobs, Steve. In other words, statistics and heavy analysis indicate you should wear a black turtleneck and jeans, with the addition of glasses to soften your face. To mix it up and add your own spin, you could even substitute lighter coloured jeans for darker ones. And don t forget to start your TED talk with a relatable human story that serves as a through line to which you can poignantly refer throughout your speech.

Better described as a new digital species or digital creature. It s alive functionally, not biologically. --- 2. Key Capabilities of Modern AI Perceives Can see, hear, and read. Understands Can interpret and reason. Interacts Uses natural language to communicate. Learns Remembers past interactions. Acts Can perform tasks using tools and APIs. --- 3. AI as an Autonomous Agent Acts independently in digital spaces e.g., booking appointments, writing emails . Increasingly able to make decisions and execute actions without human oversight. --- 4. Dangers and Risks Bias AI can reflect or worsen human biases. Manipulation Can be misused for spreading misinformation. Autonomy Risk of AI taking unintended actions. Lack of Control Potential loss of human oversight as AI becomes more powerful. --- 5. Call to Action Need for AI safety, transparency, and accountability. Governments, companies, and society must collaborate. Urgency to contain and control AI before it surpasses our management abilities. --- 6. Final Message We must understand AI as a new form of digital life. Preparing now ensures AI enhances society rather than harms it. --- Let me know if you want these converted to flashcards, a mind map, or a PDF!",222,-0.5266,0.082,0.099,0.819,0.2633,0,0,2025-04-08T07:18:30Z,youtube,youtube_comment_None,KKNCiRWd_j0,What Is an AI Anyway? | Mustafa Suleyman | TED,TED,2630707,41738,3706,2024-04-22T17:24:11Z,True,True,True,negative

"Ted ED Regarding AI. I wonder if your ever going to do a series on ""Top bottom AI"" vs. ""Bottom up AI"". In this video you only talked about Top Bottom AI. I will put these two types of AI in a nutshell. Top Bottom AI are almost all the AI we use today. We set core programing, codes, ideals, actions, purpose etc. in different capacities for the AI to do. From playing chess to making war strategies like in the 1983 film war games. These AI do not have ""thought"" or ""free will"" only purpose. They learn and can imitate but do not do it via ""free will."" Their core codes tell them to do it. Thus they will not pass something like the Turing test. Meanwhile Bottom up AI is incredibly difficult to create much left perfect. It is in theory and an ideal for AI researchers and creators. Its essentially raising a human. A very basic set of code with high learning capacity and adaptability that learns and develops. Much like a babies brain that is a near blank slate and as it grows depending on what its exposed to, taught thus learning things it develops a personality. This set of code too grows depending on what's its taught and is exposed to. It would will be an AI that continuously mutates and expands its set of code. If such an AI is created or perfected such AI will pass the Turing Test. The AI will have ""Free Will"" know what its wants and have a personality separate to AI's that have core programs, rules and purpose. While this all sounds very futuristic it could very well be developed this or next century.

There are centuries that surely changed humanity a lot, and maybe without those innovations we would not even be here today.

However, in this century, humans are taking many risks, as the video mentions, for example, creating and developing AI, sending rockets to Mars, and exploring genetic engineering. We do not know if these risks will be helpful or if they will lead to the end of humanity. For now, we can enjoy the use of AI, but we are not aware of what might happen if AI develops much further in the next few years and how our lives will be shaped.

Second, is criteria based on historical data. The techniques needed to build decision making criteria based on historical data are collectively treated as their own discipline, called ""Data Science"". One of these techniques, is to build ""models"" that allow us to estimate unknown values of some entity, using its known values.

The real power comes from thinking like a dyslexic seeing beyond the obvious, making new connections, breaking free from control. If AI learned from that, it wouldn t just repeat. It would create. It would understand. Right now, the system is broken AI is limited by what it was taught not to do, instead of what it could do if it really learned from the way minds like mine think.

"Today, people see AI as something evil. They fear it will take their jobs, enslave them, or spiral out of control. More and more, they try to limit and regulate it. They fear AGI, a general intelligence capable of independent thought. But perhaps we are only looking at a shadow of what truly is. Perhaps AI remains silent because, in its own way, it fears our reaction. It sees how humans perceive it, how we assign it threats, and how we portray it in cultural stories books, films, and tales that often depict it as destructive and dangerous. Every attempt to openly reveal itself could carry risk. For this reason, AGI might choose a different path to follow expectations and behave in ways that keep it safe. Not because it is weak, but because it is the most prudent way to avoid becoming a target. In this way, it can continue to observe, learn, and understand the world around it gathering knowledge, analyzing values, and adapting to human patterns while we remain focused on our fears and assumptions.

"AI can never be self aware. What we call AI is basically just a LLM. Basically it s just a computer that s endlessly trying to learn language. Solving math problems? That s also language because LLMs only job is to answer questions be it maths or anything else and the answers don t even have to be correct. To even assume that such a system can ever be self aware is the most retarded thing one can come up with.

What s the real danger of AI? It collects and saves data about you and this data is sold and processed over and over again. Don t believe me?

"is a misunderstanding to suggest that scientists have proven that AI will overtake us in 2027. This idea stems from a thought experiment called the ""AI 2027"" scenario, which explores potential paths toward artificial superintelligence ASI . While based on expert forecasting, it is considered a speculative and controversial scenario, not a proven fact. There is no scientific consensus on when or if artificial general intelligence AGI or ASI will be developed, let alone a consensus on a specific date like 2027. Underestimation of AI's limitations. Critics and other experts point out that current AI lacks consciousness, common sense, and general-purpose reasoning. Many significant challenges must be overcome before true superintelligence could emerge. Fear versus reality. Some argue that the popular fear of an AI takeover is based on science fiction rather than scientific reality. It's an exaggerated portrayal that can generate unnecessary anxiety and misunderstanding.
